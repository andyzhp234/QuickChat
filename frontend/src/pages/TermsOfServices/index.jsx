        are pieces of information that are passed to your browser and stored on
        your computer's hard drive. We use cookies on our website to enhance
        your experience and for authentication purposes. The cookie we use is an
        httponly cookie, which is a functional cookie that is used solely for
        authentication purposes. This cookie is not used to track your activity
        on our website or collect any personal information about you. It is also
        not accessible to any third-party websites. You can adjust cookie
        retention settings and accept or block individual cookies in your
        browser settings, although our apps won't work and other aspects of our
        service may not function properly if you turn cookies off. By using our
        website, you consent to the use of this cookie for authentication
        purposes. Accounts created on our website are subject to periodic
        deletion. While we make every effort to delete accounts in a timely
        manner, the exact timing of these deletions may vary and is not
        guaranteed. By creating an account on our website, you acknowledge and
        agree that your account may be deleted at any time without prior notice.
        We collect certain information about users of our chat app, including
        their IP addresses, to implement rate limiting and prevent spamming.
        Specifically, we save the IP address of the sender and the number of
        requests being sent within the last 60 seconds in Redis for the purpose
        of rate limiting. This information is only used for the purpose of rate
        limiting and will be deleted after 60 seconds. If a user reaches the
        rate limit, their IP address will be temporarily blocked for a certain
        period of time. We take the privacy of our users seriously and do not
        share this information with third parties, except as required by law.
        We'll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we
